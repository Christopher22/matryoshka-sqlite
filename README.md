# matryoshka(-sqlite)
matryoshka is a simple yet powerful virtual file system stored in any SQLite database. Written in Rust, it combines the advantages of high performance with supreme compile-time safety checks. Primarily, its code is deployed as a shared library accessible in other programming languages. Currently, binding both for Python and .NET are supported and regularly tested during continuous integration.
